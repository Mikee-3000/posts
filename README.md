# Posts app
To run this:

```sh
npm install
node app.js
```

The first run will create an Sqlite3 db file called `db.sqlite`, provided it doesn't exist.
At least one user is automatically created, the username is `admin` and password is `admin123` (for any accidental visitors, this is a school project, please don't comment.)
